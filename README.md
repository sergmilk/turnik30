# turnik30
This is GDG&WTM Hackaton (24-26 Nov 2017) task repository for turnik30.ru project.

The main Idea is to study blockchain and smart contracts.

Stage 0:

Deploy a web page able to store data in local storage


Stage 1:

Push this data to some blockchain block

<- Would be enough for this weekend


Stage 2:

Create a smart contract that will operate with data stored in local storage, or read from blockchain. 
Smart contract should unlock access to the funds after a certain period of time and a vote of certain token holders (?)



-----------------------------

P.S> Certain mechanics and logic of smart contract should be worked on after stage 1.
